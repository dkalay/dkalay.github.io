I'm currently at Rutgers as an undergraduate studying chemical engineering with economics. My research work originated with developing inorganic compounds to act as efficient materials for energy storage. I'm currently working on developing exotic materials to achieve a similar purpose. I like to use theoretical models to guide experimental procedures through the aid of mathematical principles in a programming landscape.
